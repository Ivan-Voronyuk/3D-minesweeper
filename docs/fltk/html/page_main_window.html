Main Application Window</div></div>
 <p>A FLUID project is a hierarchy of nodes. Each node holds information to generate C++ source code which in turn generates the user interface that is created in the layout editor windows. Projects usually define one or more functions. These functions can generate one or more FLTK windows and all the widgets that go inside those windows.</p>
<p>The FLUID Main Window is split into three parts. The title bar shows the status of the source and project files. The menu bar provides a wealth of menu items for all major actions in FLUID. The biggest part of the app window is the widget browser, a tree structure that lists every code node and widget in the project.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="main_titlebar"></a>
Title Bar</h1>
<div class="image">
<img src="main_titlebar.png" alt=""/>
</div>
 <p>The title bar shows the status of the project file, <em>function_panel.fl</em> in this case, followed by an asterisk if the project was changed after it was saved. If the asterisk shows, FLUID will ask the user to save changes before closing the project, loading another project, or starting a new one. Pressing <code>Ctrl-S</code> will save the project and make the asterisk disappear.</p>
<p>The _.cxx_ in the title bar reflects the status of header and source files in relation to the project. A trailing asterisk indicates that the project and code files differ. Pressing <code>Ctrl-Shift-C</code> to write the code files will make this asterisk go away.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>FLUID currently supports only one open project at a time.</dd></dl>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="main_menubar"></a>
Application Menu Bar</h1>
<div class="image">
<img src="main_menubar.png" alt=""/>
</div>
 <p>The menu bar is the true control center of FLUID. All actions start here.</p>
<p>The <em>File</em> menu offers the common file operation for FLUID projects. Projects can be loaded, merged, and saved. <em>Print</em> will print a snapshot of all open project windows. The <em>New From Template</em> item opens a dialog that provides access to a small number of sample projects. More projects can be added using <em>Save as Template</em>.</p>
<p>Use <em>Write Code</em> to write the header and source code files, and <em>Write Strings</em> to write the translation file if one of the internationalization options is active.</p>
<p>The <em>Edit</em> menu is mainly used to manipulate widgets within the widget tree. The bottom entries toggle various dialogs and pop up the settings panel.</p>
<p>The <em>New</em> menu holds a list of all widgets that can be used in FLUID. They are grouped by functionality, very similarly to the widget bin. New widgets are added inside or right after the selected widget. If the parent widget is not compatible, FLUID tries to find another location for the widget. If that also fails, FLUID will pop up a dialog, describing the required parent type.</p>
<p>The <em>Layout</em> menu is used to adjust the position and size of widgets in relation to each other.</p>
<p>The <em>Shell</em> menu gives quick access to user definable shell scripts. Note that scripts can be stored inside <code>.fl</code> project files.</p>
<dl class="section see"><dt>See also</dt><dd><a class="el" href="page_main_window.html#main_menu_items">The Main Menu</a></dd></dl>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="main_widget_browser"></a>
Widget Tree View</h1>
<div class="image">
<img src="main_browser.png" alt=""/>
</div>
 <p>Widgets are stored in a hierarchy. You can open and close a level by clicking the "triangle" at the left of a widget. The leftmost widgets are the <em>parents</em>, and all the widgets listed below them are their <em>children</em>. Parents don't have to have any children.</p>
<p>The top level of the hierarchy is composed of <em>functions</em> and <em>classes</em>. Each of these will produce a single C++ public function or class in the output <code>.cxx</code> file. Calling the function or instantiating the class will create all of the child widgets.</p>
<p>The second level of the hierarchy contains the <em>windows</em>. Each of these produces an instance of class <a class="el" href="classFl__Window.html">Fl_Window</a>.</p>
<p>Below that are either <em>widgets</em> (subclasses of <a class="el" href="classFl__Widget.html">Fl_Widget</a>) or <em>groups</em> of widgets (including other groups). Plain groups are for layout, navigation, and resize purposes. <em>Tab groups</em> provide the well-known file-card tab interface.</p>
<p>Widgets are shown in the browser by either their <em>name</em> (such as "Button emergency_btn" in the example), or by their <em>type</em> and <em>label</em> (such as "Double_Window "My Main Window"").</p>
<p>You <em>select</em> widgets by clicking on their names, which highlights them (you can also select widgets from any displayed window). You can select many widgets by dragging the mouse across them, or by using Shift+Click to toggle them on and off. To select no widgets, click in the blank area under the last widget. Note that hidden children may be selected even when there is no visual indication of this.</p>
<p>You <em>open</em> widgets by double-clicking on them, or (to open several widgets you have picked) by typing the F1 key. A control panel will appear so you can change the widget(s).</p>
<p>Nodes are moved within their group using <code>F2</code> and <code>F3</code>. They can be grouped and ungrouped with <code>F7</code> and <code>F8</code>, and relocated by selecting them and using cut, copy, and paste.</p>
<p>Every line in the browser has the same basic format. The level of indentation reflects the depth of a node within the tree.</p>
<p>The triangle appears only in front of nodes that can have children. If it is white, the group has no children. If it is black, there is at least one child. If the triangle points to the right, the children are hidden in the tree view. Click the triangle to reveal all children.</p>
<p>The icon to the right is a small representation of the base type of the node. Widgets are gray, windows have a blue title bar, and functional nodes are green. If the widget is static or private, a padlock icon will appear in the bottom right corner of the type icon.</p>
<p>The content of text fields depends on the node type. If a comment is set, it appears in green over the text. Widgets combine their type (bold black) and label text (red), or their C++ name in black (not bold).</p>
<p>All colors and font styles can be customized in the User tab of the Settings panel.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="main_menu_items"></a>
The Main Menu</h1>
<p>The "New" menu of the main menu bar is duplicated as a pop-up menu on any layout editor window. The shortcuts for all the menu items work in any window. The menu items are:</p>
<p><b>File &gt; New (Ctrl+n)</b>: Close the current project and start a new, empty project.</p>
<p><b>File &gt; Open... (Ctrl+o)</b>: Discard the current editing session and read in a different <code>.fl</code> project file. You are asked for confirmation if you have changed the current file.</p>
<p>FLUID can also read <code>.fd</code> files produced by the Forms and XForms "fdesign" programs. It is best to <em>File &gt; Merge</em> them instead of opening them. FLUID does not understand everything in a <code>.fd</code> file, and will print a warning message on the controlling terminal for all data it does not understand. You will probably need to edit the resulting setup to fix these errors. Be careful not to save the file without changing the name, as FLUID will write over the <code>.fd</code> file with its own format, which fdesign cannot read!</p>
<p><b>File &gt; Insert... (Ctrl+i)</b>: Insert the contents of another <code>.fl</code> file without changing the name of the current <code>.fl</code> file. All the functions (even if they have the same names as the current ones) are added, and you will have to use cut/paste to put the widgets where you want.</p>
<p><b>File &gt; Save (Ctrl+s)</b>: Write the current data to the <code>.fl</code> file. If the file is unnamed then FLUID will ask for a filename.</p>
<p><b>File &gt; Save As... (Ctrl+Shift+S)</b>: Ask for a new filename and save the file.</p>
<p><b>File &gt; Save A Copy...</b>: Save a copy of the <code>.fl</code> data to a different file.</p>
<p><b>File &gt; Revert...</b>: Revert the <code>.fl</code> data to the previously saved state.</p>
<p><b>File &gt; New From Template...</b>: Create a new user interface design from a previously saved template. This can be useful for including a predefined enterprise copyright message for projects, or for managing boilerplate code for repeating project code.</p>
<p><b>File &gt; Save As Template...</b>: Save the current project as a starting point for future projects.</p>
<p><b>File &gt; Print... (Ctrl-P)</b>: Generate a printout containing all currently open windows within your project.</p>
<p><b>File &gt; Write Code (Ctrl+Shift+C)</b>: Write the GUI layout as a <code>.cxx</code> and <code>.h</code> file. These are exactly the same as the files you get when you run FLUID with the <code>-c</code> switch.</p>
<p>The output file names are the same as the <code>.fl</code> file, with the leading directory and trailing ".fl" stripped, and ".h" or ".cxx" appended.</p>
<p><b>File &gt; Write Strings (Ctrl+Shift+W)</b>: Write a message file for all of the text labels and tooltips defined in the current file.</p>
<p>The output file name is the same as the <code>.fl</code> file, with the leading directory and trailing ".fl" stripped, and ".txt", ".po", or ".msg" appended depending on the <a class="el" href="page_setting_dialog.html#setting_i18n">Internationalization Mode</a>.</p>
<p><b>File &gt; Quit (Ctrl+q)</b>: Exit FLUID. You are asked for confirmation if you have changed the current file.</p>
<p><b>Edit &gt; Undo (Ctrl+z)</b> and <b>Redo (Shift+Ctrl+z)</b>: FLUID saves the project state for undo and redo operations after every major change.</p>
<p><b>Edit &gt; Cut (Ctrl+x)</b>: Delete the selected widgets and all of their children. These are saved to a "clipboard" file and can be pasted back into any FLUID window.</p>
<p><b>Edit &gt; Copy (Ctrl+c)</b>: Copy the selected widgets and all of their children to the "clipboard" file.</p>
<p><b>Edit &gt; Paste (Ctrl+v)</b>: Paste the widgets from the clipboard file.</p>
<p>If the widget is a window, it is added to whatever function is selected, or contained in the current selection.</p>
<p>If the widget is a normal widget, it is added to whatever window or group is selected. If none is, it is added to the window or group that is the parent of the current selection.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion, it is best to select exactly one widget before doing a paste.</p>
<p>Cut/paste is the only way to change the parent of a widget.</p>
<p><b>Edit &gt; Duplicate (Ctrl-u)</b>: Duplicate all currently selected widgets and insert the duplicates after the last selected widget.</p>
<p><b>Edit &gt; Delete</b>: Delete all selected widgets.</p>
<p><b>Edit &gt; Select All (Ctrl+a)</b>: Select all widgets in the same group as the current selection.</p>
<p>If they are all selected already then this selects all widgets in that group's parent. Repeatedly typing <code>Ctrl+a</code> will select larger and larger groups of widgets until everything is selected.</p>
<p><b>Edit &gt; Properties... (F1 or double click)</b>: Display the current widget in the widgets panel. If the widget is a window and it is not visible then the window is shown instead.</p>
<p><b>Edit &gt; Sort</b>: Sort the selected widgets into left to right, top to bottom order. You need to do this to make navigation keys in FLTK work correctly. You may then fine-tune the sorting with "Earlier" and "Later". This does not affect the positions of windows or functions.</p>
<p><b>Edit &gt; Earlier (F2)</b>: Move all of the selected widgets one earlier in order among the children of their parent (if possible). This will affect navigation order, and if the widgets overlap it will affect how they draw, as the later widget is drawn on top of the earlier one. You can also use this to reorder functions, classes, and windows within functions.</p>
<p><b>Edit &gt; Later (F3)</b>: Move all of the selected widgets one later in order among the children of their parent (if possible).</p>
<p><b>Edit &gt; Group (F7)</b>: Create a new <a class="el" href="classFl__Group.html">Fl_Group</a> and make all the currently selected widgets children of that group.</p>
<p><b>Edit &gt; Ungroup (F8)</b>: Move the selected children of a group out of the group and up one level in the hierarchy. If all children of a group are selected and moved, the remaining empty group is deleted.</p>
<p><b>Edit &gt; Show or Hide Overlays (Ctrl+Shift+O)</b>: Toggle the display of the red overlays off, without changing the selection. This makes it easier to see box borders and how the layout looks. The overlays will be forced back on if you change the selection.</p>
<p><b>Edit &gt; Show or Hide Guides (Ctrl+Shift+G)</b>: Guides can be used to arrange a widget layout easily and consistently. They indicate preferred widget positions and sizes with user definable margins, grids, and gap sizes. See the "Layout" tab in the "Settings" dialog, <a class="el" href="page_setting_dialog.html#setting_layout">Layout Preferences</a>.</p>
<p>This menu item enables and disables guides and the snapping action when dragging widgets and their borders.</p>
<p><b>Edit &gt; Show or Hide Restricted (Ctrl+Shift+R)</b>: The behavior of overlapping widgets in FLTK is undefined. By activating this button, a hatch pattern is shown, highlighting areas where restricted or undefined behavior may occur.</p>
<p><b>Edit &gt; Show or Hide Widget Bin (Alt+B)</b>: The widget bin provides quick access to all widget types supported by FLUID. Layouts can be created by clicking on elements in the widget bin, or by dragging them from the bin to their position within the layout. This button shows or hides the widget bin.</p>
<p><b>Edit &gt; Show or Hide Code View (Alt+C)</b>: Shows or hide the source code preview window. Any changes to the layout or code in the layout editor can be previewed and verified immediately in the Code View window.</p>
<p><b>Edit &gt; Settings... (Alt+p)</b>: Open the application and project settings dialog: <a class="el" href="page_setting_dialog.html">Settings Dialog</a></p>
<p><b>New &gt; Code &gt; Function</b>: Create a new C function. You will be asked for a name for the function. This name should be a legal C++ function template, without the return type. You can pass arguments which can be referred to by code you type into the individual widgets.</p>
<p>If the function contains any unnamed windows, it will be declared as returning an <a class="el" href="classFl__Window.html">Fl_Window</a> pointer. The unnamed window will be returned from it (more than one unnamed window is useless). If the function contains only named windows, it will be declared as returning nothing (<code>void</code> ).</p>
<p>It is possible to make the <code>.cxx</code> output be a self-contained program that can be compiled and executed. This is done by deleting the function name so <code>main(argc,argv)</code> is used. The function will call <code>show()</code> on all the windows it creates and then call <code><a class="el" href="classFl.html#a7a3b1236b41800d24267288c564b187a">Fl::run()</a></code>. This can also be used to test resize behavior or other parts of the user interface.</p>
<p>You can change the function name by double-clicking on the function.</p>
<dl class="section see"><dt>See also</dt><dd><a class="el" href="page_functional_nodes.html#functional_function">Function and Method Panel</a></dd></dl>
<p><b>New &gt; Group &gt; Window</b>: Create a new <a class="el" href="classFl__Window.html">Fl_Window</a> widget. The window is added to the currently selected function, or to the function containing the currently selected item. The window will appear, sized to 480x320. You can resize it to whatever size you require.</p>
<p>The widget panel will also appear and is described later in this chapter.</p>
<p><b>New &gt; ...</b>: All other items on the New menu are subclasses of <code><a class="el" href="classFl__Widget.html">Fl_Widget</a></code>. Creating them will add them to the currently selected group or window, or the group or window containing the currently selected widget. The initial dimensions and position are chosen by copying the current widget, if possible.</p>
<p>When you create the widget you will get the widget's control panel, which is described later in this chapter.</p>
<p><b>Layout &gt; Align &gt; ...</b>: Align all selected widgets to the first widget in the selection.</p>
<p><b>Layout &gt; Space Evenly &gt; ...</b>: Space all selected widgets evenly inside the selected space. Widgets will be sorted from first to last.</p>
<p><b>Layout &gt; Make Same Size &gt; ...</b>: Make all selected widgets the same size as the first selected widget.</p>
<p><b>Layout &gt; Center in Group &gt; ...</b>: Center all selected widgets relative to their parent widget</p>
<p><b>Layout &gt; Synchronized Resize</b>: If unchecked, groups and windows can be resized without resizing their children. If set, the layout of the children is changed according to their <code>resize()</code> settings. Try <b>Live Resize</b> to verify the effects before permanently modifying the layout.</p>
<p><b>Layout &gt; Grid and Size Settings... (Ctrl+g)</b>: Display the grid settings panel. See <a class="el" href="page_setting_dialog.html#setting_layout">Layout Preferences</a> .</p>
<p>This panel controls dimensions that all widgets snap to when you move and resize them, and for the "snap" which is how far a widget has to be dragged from its original position to actually change.</p>
<p>Layout preferences are defined using margins to parent groups and windows, gaps between widget, and/or by overlaying a grid over a group or window. A layout comes as a suite of three presets, one for the main application window, one for dialog boxes, and one for toolboxes.</p>
<p>FLUID comes with two included layout suites. <code>FLTK</code> was used to design FLUID and other included apps, and <code>Grid</code> is a more rigid grid layout. Users can add more suites, import and export them, and include them into their <code>.fl</code> project files.</p>
<p><b>Shell &gt; Customize... (Alt+x)</b>: Displays the shell command settings panel. Shell commands are commonly used to run a 'make' script to compile the FLUID output. See <a class="el" href="page_setting_dialog.html#setting_shell">Shell Commands</a> .</p>
<p><b>Help &gt; About FLUID</b>: Pops up a panel showing the version of FLUID. </p>
